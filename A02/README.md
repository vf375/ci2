The script decides whether the correct number of arguments (at least one other than script name) was used. If not, it shows the proper format. If yes, an object with the text file name as an instance variable runs a loop which counts the total number of lines and also the number of lines with the word "sed" in the target text file. These numbers are printed at the end.

Command to run: python texter.py <file_name.txt>
